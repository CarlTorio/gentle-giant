                  Growing up, Esperanza watched her grandmother prepare herbal remedies and perform traditional healing rituals. These early memories planted the seeds of her lifelong dedication to natural wellness. Driven by a desire to help others, she pursued extensive training in holistic healing modalities — from traditional Filipino Hilot massage to Traditional Chinese Medicine techniques including Auriculo Therapy, Guasha, Moxibustion, Cupping, and Acupuncture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her dedication led her to complete certifications from Asian Manual International Inc. as an Auriculo Chiro Manual Therapy Practitioner, and she earned the distinguished title of Certified Natural Practitioner (CNP). Her pursuit of knowledge culminated in receiving her Doctor of Humanities degree from the Watchman Ministry of Academics — a testament to her commitment to the healing arts and service to humanity.
